The reason this project exists is to create a resilient, secure and scalable enterprise network infrastructure that optimally and fully serves the academic, administrative, and operational activities in TTIâ€™s multi-campus structure. The design served does both the present needs and the future growth due to persistent availability in uninterrupted access, management, and policy application(audit) throughout all campuses.

Our works includes the design of the Layer 2 and Layer 3 topologies, secure site-to-site WAN access through the BCNET/CANARIE infrastructure, and the Active Directory service integration with DNS, DHCP, GPO, and other IAM services for control and policy enforcement. Moreover, we are implementing a secure Internet Edge with Cisco ASA appliances, VLAN Firewall segmentation for departmental isolation, and central Splunk logging fort real-time monitoring and fault detection.
