# Enterprise-Network-Project-

The reason this project exists is to create a resilient, secure and scalable enterprise network infrastructure that optimally and fully serves the academic, administrative, and operational activities in TTI’s multi-campus structure. The design served does both the present needs and the future growth due to persistent availability in uninterrupted access, management, and policy application(audit) throughout all campuses. 

 Our works includes the design of the Layer 2 and Layer 3 topologies, secure site-to-site WAN access through the BCNET/CANARIE infrastructure, and the Active Directory service integration with DNS, DHCP, GPO, and other IAM services for control and policy enforcement. Moreover, we are implementing a secure Internet Edge with Cisco ASA appliances, VLAN Firewall segmentation for departmental isolation, and central Splunk logging fort real-time monitoring and fault detection.  

Each element of the network is realizing high availability and responsiveness such that they are always available and when an outage occurs the services are still maintained and smoothly delivered, sustain TTI's digital operations. 



Problem Statement and Proposed Solution  

With its campuses located in Burnaby, Richmond, and Downtown Vancouver, the Technical Training Institute of BC (TTI) is an emerging educational institution that is facing numerous network problems related to expansion, security, and central management. The existing system does not have a cohesive framework to cross regional borders for servicing the network, which results in poorly coordinated and inefficient services at different locations. The absence of a uniform addressing scheme leads to conflicts in IP addresses as well as unproductive and elaborate routing paths. Additionally, TTI's dependence on IPv4 along with legacy security risks due to insufficient segmentation of Local Area Networks (LANs) increases the risk of security breaches and performance bottlenecks. Communication between different sites is erratic and prone to failure; unhindered central directory services stymie the enforcement of important security controls throughout the entire institution. 

Motivated by these issues, we developed a network architecture that is modular, secure, and scalable. The architecture incorporates both IPv4 and IPv6 addressing, centralized services with Microsoft Active Directory, and secured WAN communication over BCNET/CANARIE infrastructure. Department traffic will be VLAN segmented, and service availability will be ensured through high-availability solutions such as DHCP failover, redundant domain controllers, and clustering to enable 24/7 operational continuity. Deployment of Cisco ASA firewalls will protect the Internet Edge, and centralized log management will be performed using Splunk for complete environment visibility and alerting. The solution is compliant with TTI’s operational needs while ensuring minimal change will be needed later for cloud integration, ISP transition, or other future requirements. 

TTI’s inter-campus communication is one of their priorities and concerns. BCNET/CANARIE, for example, has fiber and copper links between campuses, but they are functioning below their optimal potential in regard to bandwidth, routing security, and path efficiency. We are proposing the construction of additional IPv4-contained cross zonal transport using MPLS Layer 3 VPNs to produce redundancies within the WAN paths with Provider Independence. For this, we will use OSPF or BGP in dynamic routing to allow inter and intra domain route fail over and outage recovery during outages.

Another significant concern is network segmentation and security. Currently, different departments (e.g., HR, Finance, Sales) operate within flat broadcast domains, making it easy for threats to propagate. We address this by introducing VLAN-based segmentation, where each department is isolated using Layer 2 boundaries, and inter-VLAN routing is handled at the distribution layer with ACLs to control access. Rogue device insertion and unauthorized network access are mitigated using DHCP snooping, port security, and centralized control via a secured Network Operations Centre (NOC) located at the Burnaby campus.  

The Active Directory (AD) infrastructure is another critical element of our proposal. We are deploying a single-domain, multi-site AD topology with domain controllers at each campus to ensure local authentication, reduce latency, and maintain service availability in case of link failure. Each campus will have its own Organizational Units (OUs) for servers and workstations, and Group Policy Objects (GPOs) will be used to enforce enterprise-wide security policies. Users will be created for each department, and permissions will follow the principle of least privilege. GPOs will enforce password complexity, restrict USB usage, configure Windows Defender, and map shared drives based on group membership.  

High availability and redundancy are central to our network services strategy. DHCP will be configured in a failover mode using Microsoft’s DHCP failover feature. DNS will have scavenging enabled, reverse zones created, and all NS records validated. Furthermore, we will implement Windows Server Failover Clustering at the Burnaby datacenter. A clustered file server will provide departmental shares (e.g., HR, Finance, AllStaff) with NTFS permissions controlled via AD security groups. This ensures that users always have access to critical files even in the event of hardware or service failure.  

To support operational excellence and troubleshooting, we are deploying centralized logging using Splunk. All logs from Cisco equipment, domain controllers, and workstations will be forwarded to a Splunk Universal Forwarder, which will then transmit them to a centralized Splunk server. This ensures complete visibility, real-time alerting, and traceability of network activity. Logs will be time-synchronized using UTC from a Stratum-2 public time source and include hostnames to enable easy correlation and incident response.  

Finally, recognizing TTI’s long-term vision of expanding into the cloud, our design incorporates optional AWS integration. This involves extending services like DNS, directory sync, or web application hosting into the cloud using Amazon’s free-tier offerings. This not only provides a scalable testbed for hybrid deployments but also prepares TTI for future cloud transitions while minimizing cost.  

In summary, our proposed network solution for TTI is tailored to meet the institution’s specific needs: secure and redundant WAN connectivity, logically segmented and secured LANs, centralized and reliable directory services, high-availability network infrastructure, comprehensive monitoring, and cloud readiness. It addresses existing pain points while providing the foundation for future scalability and digital transformation.
